These indicators have\nalready shown meaningful differences in other analyses.”\nThe respondents rated their satisfaction with different life\ndomains on a scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (com-\npletely satisfied).

After this, how-\never, women’s satisfaction began to catch up and men were\nonly 0.2 points more satisfied than women by 2021. While\npersonal income satisfaction has increased over time for both\nmen and women, the increase was much greater for women.\nWhile there are many reasons for the gender gap in personal\nincome satisfaction, the main reason is likely that women\nstill earn less than men. In 2005, the gender pay gap was\naround 16.8 percent. By 2021, it had shrunk to 13.5 percent.”\nThus, women and men have converged in terms of income\nsatisfaction, similarly to how they are converging in wages.\n\nThere are also differences between east and west Germany.\nFor example, people in east Germany are considerably more\ndissatisfied with their personal income compared to peo-\nple in west Germany. The average value in east Germany\nwas 4.9 points in 2004 compared to an average 5.7 points\nin west Germany. By 2021, the personal income satisfaction\ngap between east and west Germany had shrunk consider-\nably. In 2021, east Germans (6.7) were nearly as satisfied as\nwest Germans (6.9). The pay gap between east and west,\nwhich has become smaller over the years, may be relevant\nhere. While the gross hourly wage in east Germany was only\naround 75 percent of the gross hourly wage in west Germany\nin 2004, it had increased to around 87 percent in 2021.\"\n\nIn regards to age, people below 30 were considerably less sat-\nisfied with their personal income (4.9) than people above 30\n(5.7}, although the gap has decreased over the years. In 2021,\nfor example, younger adults’ personal income satisfaction\nwas 6.5, while it was 6.9 for older adults over 30. People who\nare finishing training or an apprenticeship or who recently\nbegan their professional career were increasingly more sat-\nisfied with their personal income. One possible reason for\nthis could be how the labor market has changed over the\nlast 20 years. The early 2000s were characterized by unem-\nployment and limited labor market prospects, especially for\nyoung people.’ By 2022, half of all companies were affected\nby a shortage of skilled professionals.” This is likely to have\nhad a positive impact on starting salaries and the general\nlabor market for young people. This was then possibly also\nreflected in young people’s income satisfaction.\n\nIn terms of household income, the respondents are divided\ninto three groups of equal size and compared: the lowest\nincome earners (first tercile), the middle-income earners\n(second tercile), and the highest income earners (third ter-\ncile).

Considering that women, on\naverage, report lower satisfaction with their personal income\non average, this similarity is remarkable. While women are\nmore dissatisfied than men in terms of their income, other\naspects of their jobs, like colleagues, work hours, field, and\nthe demands placed on such aspects do not appear to result\nin differences in work satisfaction.\n\nCompared to west Germany, people in east Germany were\nmore dissatisfied with their work from 2004 to 2018. Despite\nthis, the gap shrunk from 0.5 to 0.3 points in this period and\nthere have been no more differences between the regions\nsince 2019. One possible explanation for these differences\nand the subsequent convergence could be economic differ-\nences between east and west Germany. For historical reasons,\nthe economic structure in east Germany differs greatly from\nthat in west Germany. For example, people in east Germany\nfrequently work in different professions than people in west\nGermany.” The headquarters and research departments of\nlarge companies are still located in the west. Above all, how-\never, unemployment in east Germany was high for a long\ntime, which likely resulted in a far more pronounced fear of\nunemployment in the east.” This could lead to average work\nsatisfaction being lower in east Germany compared to west\nGermany. Catch-up processes may ultimately have led to a\nconvergence of work satisfaction in east and west Germany.\n\nWhen comparing people under and over 30, it is noticeable\nthat the under-30 group has, on average, greater work sat-\nisfaction than the over-30 group. This gap remained largely\nconstant over the observation period. However, the differ-\nence in work satisfaction was only 0.2 points in 2021. This",

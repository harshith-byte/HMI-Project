Growth stalled\nin the emerging economies in particular; this was due to the\ndevelopment in China, where domestic demand remained\nweak. In contrast, a bit more momentum came from the\nadvanced economies, especially the United States and the\neuro area, where inflation rates continued to decline. This\nresulted in a first interest rate cut in the euro area in June.\n\nCarried by consumption and exports, the advanced econo-\nmies expanded by 0.6 percent in the second quarter. The euro\narea economy remained on its recovery path and grew again\nby 0.3 percent. Foreign trade in particular made a positive\ncontribution to growth due to rising exports. Spain (0.8 per-\ncent) and the Netherlands (1.0 percent) provided particularly\nstrong support for the economic recovery in the euro area.\nFrance and Italy also recorded positive quarterly growth in\nthe second quarter, with 0.3 percent each. Germany was the\nonly major euro area country to make a negative contribu-\ntion to growth with -0.1 percent. In the United Kingdom,\neconomic output continued to rise significantly by 0.6 per-\ncent, supported primarily by a strong increase in inventories.\n\nThe US economy also experienced strong growth of 0.7 per-\ncent in the second quarter, still driven by robust consumer\nspending and corporate investments. In contrast to its neg-\native start to the year, Japan's GDP expanded by 0.8 percent.\nTax relief and real wage growth as a result of larger wage\nincreases have spurred private consumption.\n\nAmong the emerging economies, which expanded by 0.8 per-\ncent overall, only China performed poorly: The Chinese econ-\nomy grew by merely 0.7 percent in the second quarter, com-\npared to a strong 1,5 percent in the first.

          "text": "German economy caught in a slump\n\nThe German economy remains stuck in a phase of weak\ngrowth. Following a slight 0.2 percent increase in GDP at\nthe beginning of the year, this positive development did not\ncontinue: Economic output contracted slightly by 0.1 percent\nin the second quarter (Figure 3+). A recovery failed to materi-\nalize. On the one hand, private household consumption was\nsignificantly lower than the increase in disposable income\nsince the energy crisis had suggested. On the other hand,\ninvestments in equipment and in construction slumped and\nexports declined, probably primarily due to persistent low\ndomestic and foreign demand for industrial goods.\n\nPrivate consumption contracted somewhat in the second\nquarter: Private households seem to be unsettled, both due\nto the political and economic conditions as well as the low\nbut steady rise in unemployment. This likely resulted in\nconsumers consuming less in the second quarter than they\ndid at the beginning of the year, despite strong increases in\nreal wages. In line with this, private households are saving\na bit more of their income: At 10.8 percent, the savings rate\nis currently slightly higher than in 2023.* Consumer senti-\nment is dampened, likely due to the high price level. While\ninflation has stabilized noticeably recently and consistently\nbeen under three percent since the beginning of 2024, core\ninflation and the price increases in the services sector in par-\nticular have remained elevated, likely having curbed con-\nsumption. As expected in early summer, the UEFA European\nMen’s Football Championship did not noticeably boost pri-\nvate consumption in Germany.\n\nForeign trade also did not provide any growth stimuli in\nthe second quarter. While strong exports of intermediate\ngoods, such as chemical and plastic products, had indicated\na recovery in the global industry® and thus German trade\nat the beginning of the year, exports of these goods signifi-\ncantly declined again in the second quarter. Although travel\nboosted service exports, it was unable to prevent the decline\nin exports overall. Service imports also experienced strong\ngrowth, while goods imports fell slightly. Overall, imports\nstagnated, resulting in a slightly negative balance of exports\nand imports in the second quarter.\n\nThe decline in investments was even greater. Particularly pri-\nvate investment in equipment suffered a serious slump; in\nthe second quarter, it was at its lowest level since the produc-\ntion restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. In con-\ntrast, public equipment investment had a stimulating effect.\nThe downward trend of recent years also continued in con-\nstruction investment, which declined significantly, mainly\nin residential and public construction.",
          "summarized_text": "The German economy is facing weak growth with a slight contraction in GDP in the second quarter. Private consumption, investments in equipment and construction, and exports have all slumped, leading to a stagnant economy."

While production declined slightly in\nmanufacturing, it plummeted in the construction industry.\nAsa result, the manufacturing industry as a whole reduced\nGVA by 0.3 percent. Services increased slightly, supporting\nGVA by 0.1 percent. However, it was a mixed picture in the\nindividual economic sectors. Value added in the consum-\ner-related sectors decreased, while business-related services\nwere able to expand their production. This development in\nvalue added is also reflected in the latest labor market figures:\nemployment has continued to rise overall, albeit at a slightly\nslower rate than at the beginning of the year.

Leading price indicators such as import and whole-\nsale prices also suggest this. Although some of these indi-\ncators are rising again, the rates remain well below two per-\ncent. Stable price development should strengthen consumer\nconfidence once more and stimulate private consumption.\nRobust employment expansion, which the services sector\nwill likely continue to drive, should also support private con-\nsumption.

In 2026, fiscal policy will become neutral again. In accord-\nance with fiscal policy assumptions, the majority of the Federal\nGovernment's growth initiative measures are not considered here.\n\nThe majority of fiscal measures affect private households. A DSGE\nmodel with two different household types (TANK model) is used to\nestimate the stimulating effect of private consumption and GDP\nwhile accounting for their distributional effects. To this end, a dis-\ntinction is first made between the extent to which the measures\naffect the lowest-income 40 percent of households and how the\nremaining households benefit or are negatively affected.\n\nThe 40 percent with the lowest incomes earn around 20 percent of\ntotal disposable income and have a savings rate of zero, which is\nwhy they are referred to as liquidity-constrained (LC) households.\nIn addition to private households, there are the measures that af-\nfect companies or the Federal Government. Fiscal policy measures\nare divided into six categories according to their impact on the two\nhousehold types and other actors:\n1. Measures that affect LC households only\n2. Measures that affect all households per capita\n3. Measures that affect all households proportionally to\ntheir income\n4. Measures that affect high-income households only\n5. Measures that affect companies (differentiated by effect on\nprofits and subsidies)\n\n6. Measures that affect the government\n\nSince the two household types differ in their consumption behav-\nior, the consumption effect will be highest for low-income house-\nholds in particular and decline over the other three categories.\nSome of the measures that will relieve low-income households in\nparticular are the basic income (Burgergeld) and housing bene-\nfits (Wohngeld) reforms in 2024 and the introduction of the basic\nchild benefit in 2025. Moreover, the change to the basic pension\nfrom 2024 should support low-income households. High-income\nhouseholds are likely to benefit from the Inflationsausgleichgesetz\n(Inflation Adjustment Act) and, in particular, from the correspond-\ning income tax rate adjustments, especially in 2024, but also in\n2025 and 2026.",

The measures will dampen private consumption by 0.3 in\n2024 and by 0.4 in both 2025 and 2026, primarily due to the de-\ncline in consumption among low-income households.

Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering\nits forecast for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025\nby 0.4 percentage points compared to the summer forecast.\nThe forecast was revised downward primarily due to a revi-\nsion of the reported data and the significantly weaker indica-\ntors for the German and global economy over the summer.\n\nDue to ongoing weak investment and declining labor force\npotential, potential GDP is likely to continue to develop slug-\ngishly until the end of 2029. The labor volume in particu-\nlar will decline as a result of the aging population. In light\nof the stagnation this year, the output gap is likely to grow\nand amount to -1.9 percent of potential GDP on average for\n2024. With the recovery over the coming years, the output\ngap should then shrink to -0.6 percent at the end of the short\nterm and close in 2029.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent in\n2024. In 2025 and 2026, it will likely level off at the ECB's\ntwo-percent inflation target. Thus, the inflation expectation\nfor 2024 is slightly lower compared to summer, while it\nremains unchanged for 2025. The core rate, inflation exclud-\ning energy and food, is expected to average three percent in\n2024 due to continuous strong price increases for services.\nIt will also reach the two-percent target over the course of\nthe forecast.\n\nIn addition to the global risks that are creating uncertainty for\nthe outlook of the German economy, there are also domes-\ntic risk factors. Above all, this includes political uncertainty,\nwhich is currently close to its all-time high according to the\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty Index. Although the German\nFederal Government was recently able to agree on a draft\nbudget for 2025, there are still concerns that the coalition\nparties—which are pursuing different objectives in many\nareas—are to a certain extent unable to take action. This\nmakes for an unclear economic policy framework, which\ncould more negatively impact the domestic economy than\nassumed in this forecast.\n\nThe recent results of the state elections in Thuringia and\nSaxony and the rise of the populist forces there also pose\nan additional risk. These results could increase the skilled\nworker shortage and reduce Germany’s attractiveness as an\neconomic location.\n\nIn addition, right-wing and left-wing populist parties could\nperform well in the upcoming 2025 Bundestag elections and\nincrease uncertainty with regard to the subsequent forma-\ntion of a government.",
